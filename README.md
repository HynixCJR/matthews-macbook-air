SOLIDWORKS files for my NAS/home server case, to be 3D printed. because buying a case off the shelf is too easy i guess

i did not create the files for the [case fans](https://grabcad.com/library/case-fan-120mm-solidworks-1), [3.5" sata hdd](https://grabcad.com/library/3-5-sata-hdd-generic-model-1), [rpi cm5 io board](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-cm5io-board-1), or [rpi cm4/cm5 antenna kit](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4-antenna-1). 

there are also parts that are not meant to be printed. for instance, the motherboard, rpi, daughterboard, fans, and hdds are not meant to be printed.
